# FastNoise

FastNoise has been designed from the ground up to be as optimised as possible without sacrificing noise quality.

This project started when my search to find a good noise library for procedural terrain generation concluded without an obvious choice. I enjoyed the options and customisation of ANL and the speed of LibNoise, so many of the techniques from these libraries and the knowledge I gained from reading through their source has gone into creating FastNoise.
